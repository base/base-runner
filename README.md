## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save base-runner
```

## Usage

```js
var runner = require('base-runner');
var Base = require('base');

runner(Base, config, argv, function(err, app, runnerContext) {
  // `err`: error object
  // `app`: instance of `base` 
  // `runnerContext`: object with `argv`, `env` and `config` properties
});
```

## API

### [runner](index.js#L35)

Create a `runner` with the given `constructor`, [liftoff](https://github.com/js-cli/js-liftoff) `config` object, `argv` object and `callback` function.

**Params**

* `Ctor` **{Function}**: Constructor to use, must inherit [base](https://github.com/node-base/base).
* `config` **{Object}**: The config object to pass to [liftoff](https://github.com/js-cli/js-liftoff).
* `argv` **{Object}**: Argv object, optionally pre-parsed.
* `cb` **{Function}**: Callback function, which exposes `err`, `app` (base application instance) and `runnerContext`
* `returns` **{Object}**

**Example**

```js
var Base = require('base');
var argv = require('minimist')(process.argv.slice(2));
var config = {
  name: 'foo',
  cwd: process.cwd(),
  extensions: {'.js': null}
};

runner(Base, config, argv, function(err, app, runnerContext) {
  if (err) throw err;
  // do stuff with `app` and `runnerContext`
  process.exit();
});
```

## Events

The following constructor events are emitted:

* [preInit](#preInit)
* [init](#init)
* [postInit](#postInit)

### preInit

Exposes `runnerContext` as the only paramter.

```js
Base.on('preInit', function(runnerContext) {
});
```

### init

Exposes `runnerContext` and `app` (the application instance) as paramters.

```js
Base.on('init', function(runnerContext, app) {
});
```

### postInit

Exposes `runnerContext` and `app` (the application instance) as paramters.

```js
Base.on('postInit', function(runnerContext, app) {
});
```

### finished

Exposes `runnerContext` and `app` (the application instance) as paramters.

```js
Base.on('finished', function(runnerContext, app) {
});
```
